## 📱 Tablet & Display Optimization
This version is specifically built to solve screen-clipping issues on mobile devices and TV overscan. 

If the bottom numbers (like 74 and 75) are hidden by your tablet's navigation bar or screen edges:
1. Tap the **Settings Gear (⚙️)** at the bottom right.
2. Adjust the **Bottom Padding** slider to push the grid upward.
3. Use the **Number Font Size** slider to shrink the text if the rows look too "squished" after adding padding.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Interactive Grid:** Tap numbers 1–75 to toggle active status (Green).
* **Smart History:** Automatically tracks and displays the last 8 numbers called in order.
* **Pattern Tracker:** A secondary 5x5 grid to highlight the winning shape for players.
* **Custom Watermark:** Integrated background logo for professional branding.
* **Display Controls:** On-the-fly adjustments for padding (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) to fit any screen or projector.
